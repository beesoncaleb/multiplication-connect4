# multiplication-connect4
A board game built in MIPS where you play against a computer to get four spaces in a row on a 6x6 board. To claim a space you must multiply two numbers and the product marks your space. 

In the game, there are two numbers A and B, they can be any number from 1-9, you can only change one at a time to claim a spot. To play the game download the MARS simulator for MIPS (https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-Compilers/Vollmar-MARS.shtml), open all the files in the simulator and select the main.asm and assemble then run.
